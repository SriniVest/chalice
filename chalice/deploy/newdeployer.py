"""Chalice deployer module.

The deployment system in chalice is broken down into a pipeline of multiple
stages.  Each stage takes the input and transforms it to some other form.  The
reason for this is so that each stage can stay simple and focused on only a
single part of the deployment process.  This makes the code easier to follow
and easier to test.  The biggest downside is that adding support for a new
resource type is split across several objects now, but I imagine as we add
support for more resource types, we'll see common patterns emerge that we can
extract out into higher levels of abstraction.

These are the stages of the deployment process.

Application Graph Builder
=========================

The first stage is the resource graph builder.  This takes the objects in the
``Chalice`` app and structures them into an ``Application`` object which
consists of various ``models.Model`` objects.  These models are just python
objects that describe the attributes of various AWS resources.  These
models don't have any behavior on their own.

Dependency Builder
==================

This process takes the graph of resources created from the previous step and
orders them such that all objects are listed before objects that depend on
them.  The AWS resources in the ``chalice.deploy.models`` module also model
their required dependencies (see the ``dependencies()`` methods of the models).
This is the mechanism that's used to build the correct dependency ordering.

Local Build Stage
=================

This takes the ordered list of resources and allows any local build processes
to occur.  The rule of thumb here is no remote AWS calls.  This stage includes
auto policy generation, pip packaging, injecting default values, etc.  To
clarify which attributes are affected by the build stage, they'll usually have
a value of ``models.Placeholder.BUILD_STAGE``.  Processors in the build stage
will replaced those ``models.Placeholder.BUILD_STAGE`` values with whatever the
"built" value is (e.g the filename of the zipped deployment package).

For example, we know when we create a lambda function that we need to create a
deployment package, but we don't know the name nor contents of the deployment
package until the ``LambdaDeploymentPackager`` runs.  Therefore, the Resource
Builder stage can record the fact that it knows that a
``models.DeploymentPackage`` is needed, but use
``models.Placeholder.BUILD_STAGE`` for the value of the filename.  The enum
values aren't strictly necessary, they just add clarity about when this value
is expected to be filled in.  These could also just be set to ``None`` and be
of type ``Optional[T]``.


Execution Plan Stage
====================

This stage takes the ordered list of resources and figures out what AWS API
calls we have to make.  For example, if a resource doesn't exist at all, we'll
need to make a ``create_*`` call.  If the resource exists, we may need to make
a series of ``update_*`` calls.  If the resource exists and is already up to
date, we might not need to make any calls at all.  The output of this stage is
a list of ``APICall`` objects.  This stage doesn't actually make the mutating
API calls, it only figures out what calls we should make.  This stage will
typically only make ``describe/list`` AWS calls.


The Executor
============

This takes the list of ``APICall`` objects from the previous stage and finally
executes them.  It also manages taking the output of API calls and storing them
in variables so they can be referenced in subsequent ``APICall`` objects (see
the ``Variable`` class to see how this is used).  For example, if a lambda
function needs the ``role_arn`` that's the result of a previous ``create_role``
API call, a ``Variable`` object is used to forward this information.

The executor also records these variables with their associated resources so a
``deployed.json`` file can be written to disk afterwards.  An ``APICall``
takes an optional resource object when it's created whose ``resource_name``
is used as the key in the ``deployed.json`` dictionary.
